Project Title: Management of Smart Energy Services (Platforms) using TNOâ€™s FlexiblePower Suite

This internship project involved developing an approach and an implementation strategy for management of smart energy services (platforms). This goal was achieved by first gaining knowledge on available literature and state-of-the-art implementations regarding network and service management, smart grid technology, smart energy services, and about TNO 's FlexiblePower Suite (FPS) functional design. Furthermore, researching and analyzing about different possible and available management approaches, methodologies, strategies,  standards, and technologies while selecting some of them in order to come up with a management approach and an implementation strategy which best suites these smart energy services (platforms). Finally, implementing the above findings and building a demonstration that illustrates these findings and their corresponding results using TNO's FlexiblePower Suite (FPS).

*Note: FPS is TNO's reference smart energy (ICT) service platform.
